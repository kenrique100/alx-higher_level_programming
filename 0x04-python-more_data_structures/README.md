- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionaries and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate over a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What are the map, reduce and filter functions

# Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
- You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

# Requirements
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.- 8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.- 8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://- github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and - [betty-doc.pl](https://- github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 6 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to - test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t - take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c - files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
